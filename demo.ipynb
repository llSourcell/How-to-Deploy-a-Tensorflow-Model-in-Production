    "\n",
    "### 4 major components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Servables\n",
    "\n",
    "- The central abstraction in TensorFlow Serving. They are the objects that clients use to perform computation (for example, a lookup or inference).\n",
    "- Flexible size (single lookup table shard, model, multiple models)\n",
    "- Good for Concurrent operations, A/B testing\n",
    "- Multiple versions of a servable in one instance helps refresh configs\n",
    "- Streams are sorted in-order like Git\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loaders\n",
    "\n",
    "- manage a servable's life cycle. Enables common infrastructure, standardizes the APIs for loading and unloading a servable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- plugin modules that originates zero or more servable streams. For each stream, a Source supplies one Loader instance for each version it wants to have loaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "- handle the full lifecycle of Servables (loading, serving, unloading)\n",
    "- listen to Sources and track all versions. \n",
    "- tries to fulfill Sources' requests, but may refuse to load an aspired version if, say, required resources aren't available. \n",
    "- may wait to unload until a newer version finishes loading, based on a policy to guarantee that at least one version is loaded at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 Step Process \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sources create Loaders for Servable Versions.\n",
    "2. Loaders are sent as Aspired Versions to the Manager, which loads and serves them to client requests.\n",
